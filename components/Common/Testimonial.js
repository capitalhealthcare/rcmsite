                  We had developed trust in the billing system after using it
                  for three years, which led us to choose Advanced Healthcare
                  Solutions for our EMR system. One of the key factors in our
                  decision was the ability to add and customize features, which
                  has made using the system highly efficient.

                  our project, working with Advanced Healthcare Solutions was a

                  decided to proceed with the transition of EMR's, and the team
                  at Advanced Healthcare Solutions was incredibly patient and
                  gracious throughout the process.
